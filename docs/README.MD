# Project

This is a simple project that should be run on localhost.

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have the "Live Server" extension installed in Visual Studio Code. If you don't have it, you can install it from the VS Code extensions marketplace.

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

3. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select "Open with Live Server". This will start the server and open your default browser at `http://localhost:5500/index.html`.

4. You can now see the project running in your browser.
